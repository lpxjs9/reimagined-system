# reimagined-system
this is an example repository of some documents to show version control in class

we are now adding ome textto the document, to see what a small change results in on the respo

## plan for later

- everyone in class creates their own repo
- they edit a markdown file
- they all tell Denis how amazing this technology is (optonal)
